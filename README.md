## Getting started

First of all, you need to clone this repo into your local machine, using:

```
git clone https://github.com/ruimak/thegig.git
```

If you have all the dependencies installed and you want to see the functions running, comment out the line 3 and 125.
Then you should be able to run the script:
```
npm test

```

If you want to run the functions for a different file, just change the pathing in line 3. All the data files are in the data folder.

## Running the tests

Script:

```
npm test

```

Tested with Mocha and Chai.
Every individual function was tested and included a custom test file.
